## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

One semester of Java basics in college made me interested in programming and I have been self-teaching myself Java (with one dip into Kotlin) ever since.

Since best way to learn anything for me is "try something and lets see how far I can get", I have been creating various projects, aimed at getting practice with Java and Spring framework. Some of the more "representative" ones are the public ones here.

In those projects, I got to play around with REST (with sprinkle of SOAP), Spring, JPA, SQL, Thymeleaf (although I found out that I am more fond of backend over front-end), and more.

When starting projects, I am often inspired by something work related, which I want to try - as such, I created connectors for connecting to various government databases, for using bank identity or autocomplete function for addresses and companies.

That is not to say that work is my only inspiration, of course, my foray into Android was inspired by my dadÂ´s joke (not to be mistaken with "dad joke") and Advent of Code is that something to spend long winter evenings.
